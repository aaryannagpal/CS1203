# CS1203 - Data Structures
## README

The repository required for the grading for Monsoon 2022 Semester, contains the required data structures and programs to code for the class as well as our own practise.


**Please note the repository [C-Prog-Lang-by-KR](https://github.com/aaryannagpal/C-Prog-Lang-by-KR) was made before this repository to track my progress of C Language since I had never used it before and to familiarize myself with it. <br><br>That repository was solely made for this course since the book was recommended as an excellent introduction to the language. Therefore, my practise is tracked completely in that repository and now I will be diving into Data Structures.**
